## Introduction

File Formatting Tool (FFT) is a Microsoft Word add-in designed to improve efficiency, consistency, and accuracy when formatting documents for health authority submissions. 

FFT is especially useful for regulatory documents that:
- Under eCTD structure
- Contain extensive tables, figures, and cross-references
- Frequent revisions and re-formatting

Three Advantages:
- Works directly inside Word
-  Applies to any Word documents
-  Keyboard-driven shortcuts

Once FFT is opened in Word, it appears as a task pane on the right side of the document.

## Settings

It is designed to help users get oriented, access documentation, and understand the Shortcut function before applying any formatting. 
Click the Setting icon in the top-right corner of the FFT pane. 

From here, users can manage:
- About - check documentation (User Guide), version and contact developer.
- Notification - enable or disable the notification for each action.
- Shortcuts - customize shortcut keys based on preference or reset to default. See 2.1 for more details.

## Step 1 Configure
Step 1 defines how FFT will prepare the document before formatting begins. 
This step allows users to load a predefined FFT template, control layout elements, and set page margins.

### 1.1 Select Module
At the top of Step 1, select the appropriate module or category from the dropdown list (for example, Module 2.5 – Clinical Overview).
The predefined style will be auto-added to the document and ready for use in the future steps.

### 1.2 Load and Configure
Load & Configure controls whether FFT should apply its predefined template to the document.

- ON (recommended for first use):
   Loads FFT-defined header, footer, and styles
   Initializes the document with the selected module template

- OFF (recommended when reopening documents):
   Keeps the existing FFT configuration
   Allows users to proceed directly to Step 2

💡 Tip: If the document already contains an FFT template, turning this option OFF prevents unnecessary reloading.

### 1.3 Load Header / Load Footer
These options allow fine control over whether FFT should overwrite existing headers and footers.

- Load Header
   ON: FFT applies the predefined header from the selected module
   OFF: Keeps the document’s existing header unchanged

- Load Footer
   ON: FFT applies the predefined footer from the selected module
   OFF: Keeps the document’s existing footer unchanged

Recommended usage
Turn OFF these options if:
- The document already contains an approved or validated header/footer
- You are working on a late-stage document and want to preserve layout

### 1.4 Page Margin Settings
Users can manually define page margins (in inches):
- Top Margin
- Bottom Margin
- Left Margin
- Right Margin



## Step 2 Format

### 2.1 Styles

### 2.2 Shortcuts

The Keyboard-driven shortcuts is one of the most distinctive and powerful features of FFT. It allows users to format paragraph entirely by keyboard, significantly improve efficiency and eliminate repetitive formatting tasks.

Three Key principles:
- Pre-defined Word Styles - all shortcuts applied one key to one style, and aligned with health authority eCTD expectations.
- Sequential Traversal - one paragraph at a time, auto-skip all the table and figure, focus on plain-text only.
- Shortcut Mode - active only when the floating window is in green with "Shortcut On" and apply only to the navigated paragraph.

#### 2.2.1 Step by Step Instruction

1. Place the Cursor
   Click anywhere inside the paragraph that needs to be formatted. The cursor should be inside plain text, not a table or figure.

2. Activate Shortcut Mode
   Move your cursor to the FFT pane, click and the floating window will change from "Shortcut Off" (grey) to "Shortcut On" (green). 
   This indicate that keyboard shortcuts are now active.

3. Navigate to the current paragraph
   Press [N] on the keyboard.
   FFT will navigate to the paragraph containing your cursor and the paragraph will become selected in grey.

4. Apply the Desired Style
   Press the corresponding shortcut key to apply a style.
   The shortcut key will appear in the parentheses with grey in the Step 2 Format section, under 2.1 Styles buttons.

5. Move to the Next paragraph
   Press [→] to move to the next paragraph.
   Repeat step 4 and 5 until the entire document is formatted.

#### 2.2.2 Default Navigation Shortcuts
   [N] – Navigate to the currently selected location
   [←] - Move to the previous paragraph
   [→] - Move to the next paragraph
   [X] - Normal (justify)
   [C] - Normal 2 (align left)
   [1~5] - Heading 1 to Heading 5
   [6] - Table title
   [7] - Figure title
   [B] - Bullets
   [V] - Numbering
